// Paying an invoice from the link in its email.
//
// Both routes are public: the payer is a parent or a customer with no account
// here and never will have one, and the signed token in the path is the whole
// of their authority. That is why these two names are registered in
// ../api-endpoints as auth (never send a Bearer token) and tenant-exempt
// (never append ?tenant=): a stale token from a staff session on the same
// browser must not change what this page does, and there is no tenant context
// to assert because nobody is signed in.
//
// The amount is NOT held here and is never sent. The backend reads the
// invoice's outstanding balance at the moment of the call, which is the reason
// the email carries a link to this page rather than a checkout URL minted when
// the invoice was posted: a payment made in between has to count.
