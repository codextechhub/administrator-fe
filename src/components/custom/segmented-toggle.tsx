/**
 * The view switch: Cards / Table, List / Tree.
 *
 * The highlight SLIDES to what you pressed rather than blinking out of one
 * option and into another. That is not decoration: the block behind the label
 * is what says "you are here", and a thing that teleports has to be re-found
 * every time, while a thing that travels carries the eye with it. Pressing
 * Table and watching the marker move from Cards is the screen answering.
 *
 * One component, because there were five copies of this toggle across the
 * academics screens and a sixth was about to be written. A shared marker is
 * also the only way the movement can be consistent - five hand-rolled ones
 * would drift in duration and easing until each screen felt slightly different.
